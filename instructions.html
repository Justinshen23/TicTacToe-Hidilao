        <h1>Tic Tac Toe Instructions</h1>
        <p>Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.</p>
        <p>The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.</p>
        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide which player will be "X" and which will be "O".</li>
            <li>Player "X" goes first, marking any empty space with an "X".</li>
            <li>Player "O" then marks an empty space with an "O".</li>
            <li>Players continue taking turns until one player has three of their marks in a row, or until all spaces are filled (resulting in a draw).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Players cannot mark a space that is already occupied.</li>
            <li>The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, or when all spaces are filled.</li>
            <li>Marks can be diagonally, horizontally, and vertically</li>
        </ul>
